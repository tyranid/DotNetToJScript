# Usage Notes

This only works from full trust JScript(obviously), so should work in
scriptlets etc. It also only works if v2/v3/v3.5 is installed. If
only v4+ is installed then the system will prompt for installation of
.NET v2. Don't think there's any way around this, seems that while the
COM objects are registered it doesn't fall-forward to using .NET 4 even
though it should work in theory.

To use this you'll need to create an assembly which targets .NET 2 (though
in most cases you can also use 3.5 as you don't tend to see .NET 2 installed
in isolation. In the assembly implement a class called TestClass which does
something you want to do in the public, parameterless constructor.
```
public class TestClass
{
    public TestClass()
    {
        /* Start notepad */
        Process.Start("notepad.exe");
    }
}
```

Ensure it's public. Then pass to this tool the path to the .NET assembly.
If you annotate the class with the ComVisible attribute you can even interact
with the object after it's created. e.g.
```
[ComVisible(true)]
public class TestClass
{
    public void DoSomething(string arg) { }
}
```
You can change the name of the entry class by using the -c switch and adding the name.
You can also get the tool to add additional code to interact with the object by
specifying the -s parameter with the path to a text file containing the additional
JScript. The created object is named 'o', so for example if you wanted to call
the DoSomething method load a file containing:
```
o.DoSomething("SomeArg");
```
The default mode is to output a JScript file which can be executed in Windows
Scripting Host. However if you want a scriptlet pass either -m (for a scriptlet
which can be used from a scriptlet moniker) or -u (for a scriptlet which can be
used from regsvr32).

Finally by default the tool will output to stdout, you can output direct to a file
using the -o switch.
